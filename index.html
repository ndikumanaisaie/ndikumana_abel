                <p>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province.[2] 
                    Given the forename Rolihlahla,[3] a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[4] in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.
                    [5] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories 
                    of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[6] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.
                    [7] Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal
                    family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.[8]

                <p>Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. 
                    There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First.
                    [52] Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.
                    [53] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house,
                     including his old friend Oliver Tambo.[54] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the 
                     "Africanist" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism 
                     and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists.[55] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, 
                     Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination.
