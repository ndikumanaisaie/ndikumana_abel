                <p>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province.[2] 
                    Given the forename Rolihlahla,[3] a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[4] in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.
                    [5] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories 
                    of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[6] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.
                    [7] Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal
                    family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.[8]

                <p>Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. 
                    There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First.
                    [52] Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.
                    [53] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house,
                     including his old friend Oliver Tambo.[54] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the 
                     "Africanist" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism 
                     and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists.[55] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, 
                     Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination.

                <p>Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–1964

                    On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick.
                     Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts,
                      although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence.[132] In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence 
                      , which feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location. Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase "the ANC's moral opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the court.[135] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes.[136] His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang    </p>
